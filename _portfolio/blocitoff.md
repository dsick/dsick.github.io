short-description: Blocitoff Todo list app

---
## Background

This was an assignment for Bloc.io. The objective was to build a todo list app that allows users to create and manage their own todo list.

## Problem

This app allows users to manage a todolist.

## Solution

This app allowed for a user to create todo lists. The app used a rake task to automatically destroy todo items that were older than 7 days.

The tools and gems used on this app where

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - application framework
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - layout framework
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - for authentication
* [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) - seeding data

## Conclusion

This was a fun project that allowed me to build a simple app that used a rake task.
