short-description: A SAAS based wiki app

---
## Background

This was an assignment for Bloc.io. The objective was to build a production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis.

## Problem

This app allows users to collaborate both publicly and privately using wikis.

## Solution

This SAAS app allowed for a free user to create, read, update and delete public wikis. Premium, paying for app could create private wikis and add specific collaborators for wikis. Wikis could be edited using markdown.

The tools and gems used on this app where

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - application framework
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - layout framework
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - for authentication
* [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) - authorization
* [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) - seeding data
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - checkout and payments
* [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) - markdown parsing

## Conclusion

This was a fun project that allowed me to build a complete app with authentication, authorization and payments.
