## Background

This was an assignment for Bloc.io. The objective was to build an app that allowed users to purchase lesson content for sports.

## Problem

This app allows an admin user to manage and create lesson content and site users to browse and purchase lesson content.

## Solution

This app used an admin interface to allow adminstrators to create lesson categories, content and pricing. Then regular users could browswer and purchase lesson content via Stripe. Coupons were available for purchase discounts Lesson that were already purchased appeared in their user profile.

The tools and gems used on this app where

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - application framework
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - layout framework
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - for authentication
* [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) - seeding data
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - checkout and payments
* [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) - admin and content management

## Conclusion

This was a fun project that allowed me to build an app that had both an admin interface and ecommerce purchasing using Stripe's coupons.
