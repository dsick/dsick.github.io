title: My Experience at Bloc
---

## Background
I have been the in application development business for quite a while, but have primarliy spent that time as a project manager, product manager, marketer and strategist. Though I coded early in my career, my development skills were currently rusty and the languages I knew were outdated. I tried multiple times to pick up Ruby on Rails, but never got past a few tutorials or sample projects. I decided to find a program that would get me over my knowledge gap. 

## Researching Options

I performed quite a bit of research to find the right program that fit my timeline and budget. I read blog posts and Quora, attended info sessions, looked at offline options and settled in on bloc.io. I wanted to keep working, so doing this program part-time was important. I also wanted 1-on-1 mentorship and believed that was best found online. Bloc.io keep coming up in my search and fit my objectives exactly. 

## The Bloc Rails Track
The rails track was well designed with a great balance of exercises with projects. This felt very real world. Each assignment used a real world workflow of specs, branches and development. The bi-weekly mentor sessions with Jon Linowes helped me get over hurdles and get to the next lesson. Following all the instruction, I had a choice of 6 projects to pursue actual development. It was challenging and rewarding experience to take my lessons and build each sample app from scratch to deploy. Making good and bad development decisions, refactoring and learning new tools and gems helped prepare me for building real world apps.

## Moving Forward
I am moving onto JavaScript course, where I hope to acheive the same success as in Rails. I'm looking forward to meeting and conquering this challange and leveling up as a full-stack developer.
